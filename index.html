        <p>
            My Sweetest Riza,<br><br>
            I hope these words find you with a heart as soft and warm as the love I feel for you. 💖<br><br>
            I want to express my sincerest apologies for any pain or disappointment I may have caused. Life sometimes throws us curveballs, and I know I’ve made mistakes along the way. Please believe me when I say that these were never intentional. If I could take away any hurt I've caused, I would do so in a heartbeat. ❤️<br><br>
            You are the light of my life, and seeing you unhappy breaks my heart. You deserve nothing but joy and love, and I deeply regret if I've been the source of any sorrow. 🌹<br><br>
            Every moment with you is precious to me, and I am committed to being the partner you deserve. I promise to learn, grow, and cherish each second we spend together. Your happiness means the world to me, and I want to do everything in my power to make things right.<br><br>
            Please find it in your heart to forgive me. Know that my love for you is endless and unwavering. I am here, ready to make amends and to show you just how much you mean to me. 🥰<br><br>
            With all my heart, and the deepest apologies,<br>
            sanskar po
